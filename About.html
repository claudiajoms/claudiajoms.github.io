<h1><center>About Claudia</h1>
	<p>Hello! My name is Claudia, and I would like to welcome you to my website! This site is for all things me. Before I get into what I am currently up to, I thought I would give some background information on myself.</p>
	<p>Born and raised in Minneapolis, Minnesota, I flew the nest when I was eighteen years old to attend the University of Wisconsin-Madison for college. It is here that I learned of my true passion for fashion. While I had always loved dressing up and was intrigued by the concept of the fashion industry, it was in my retail classes that I finally discovered what I wanted to do. Focusing on marketing and product development, I advanced in my knowledge of the fashion industry. From here, I started to play with design and styling.</p>
	<p>Working in retail, I developed my personal style immensely, in turn, affecting the style of my work. I started at GAP, which is exactly what I realized I was not interested in. I did not like how basic the clothing was, and I did appreciate the high-quality basics, but I needed to explore more. From there, I started working at Urban Outfitters and continued to do so throughout my entire college years. I fell in love with the atmosphere and the vibrance of the people that worked there. I developed a very unique eye, specialized to combine items that you would not typically pair together. I started to craft up my own sketches for designs and develop products in my marketing and entrepreneurship courses.</p>
	<p>I teamed up with one of my best friends from our campus fashion magazine, MODA, to create a few pieces. I came up with the sketches and color palette, while she got to work sewing and creating the pieces. We were an amazing team. From here, we grew as a duo. I worked on styling pieces and began posting lookbooks on Youtube to showcase my style. I would review fashion brands, speak about my own personal style and designs, with a main focus on these lookbooks that would be a few different looks styled by myself on myself. Once my videos started to get positive feedback and a decent following, I looked into more opportunities to get involved in the fashion industry. Over the course of my undergraduate years, I spent multiple summers interning in New York City for DKNY and Nylon Magazine. Being able to actually work in the fashion industry is what really shaped what I wanted to do.</p>
	<p>With my time working in fashion, my pursuit of my own collections and a growing Youtube following, I moved to New York City after graduation to pursue this dream. I have a job with Nylon Magazine working in their marketing department and running the Nylon Shop. I help with social media and ad campaigns, as well as creating the newest marketing strategies to be implemented within and outside of the magazine. In addition, my position of oversight into the Nylon Shop has been so rewarding. I curate pieces from numerous different companies for the magazine’s online store, and I get to have my own line sold exclusively through Nylon. I sketch up pieces and work with designers to get the best product possible.</p>
	<p>Where does Youtube come into the picture? I have been able to reach out to a very special audience through my time on Youtube. I interact with so many different people and get to share my creations, thoughts and ideas with others. Not only do I get to style outfits, discuss my favorite items and talk about the fashion industry, but it also has given me a platform to speak about other things as well. I have been very involved politically, and it has given me a chance to discuss what matters to me, how others can make a difference and bring awareness to important issues. It has given me the opportunity to travel and explore in a way that I never thought I would be able to in my entire life. I spent so long dreaming of what I wanted to accomplish, and I never thought I would get here. My Youtube has been a driving force in my success, and I plan to continue with it for a long time.</p>
	<p>Now, I am still living in New York City, but I have a new project. I have developed my own company. The company is called Standards, because it is a fashion company of curated pieces that are all held to sustainability standards. The concept behind the company is the mixture of a trendy, fast-fashion brand with the sustainability of a brand such as Reformation. The fashion industry is the second most harmful industry to the environment, right behind the oil industry, so it is crucial that change be created within this industry. It is so often believed that the way things are will continue, as it has been a certain way for so long. However, I want to change this concept.</p>
	<p>There is a reason so many people love the fast-fashion industry. These companies would include H&M, Forever 21 and Topshop, amongst others. These are companies that create mass quantities of clothing, using very damaging techniques to produce these products. The methods used focus on mass product and fast production, rather than taking time to create a product that will not leave a footprint on the environment of this planet. In addition, companies such as these create a mindset in the average customer that it is normal to constantly be purchasing clothing. Someone will buy five cheap t-shirts at a store and by the time that they are falling apart a month later, they will buy more. Also, the constant unveiling of new product and styles make customers constantly want to buy more.</p>
	<p>As for environmentally sustainable brands, Reformation is a prime example. Focusing on time and attention, rather than how fast they can drop product, Reformation is one of the most environmentally sustainable companies in the fashion industry. They hold every single product’s production to a standard of sustainability. Another brand that inspires me is Patagonia. They emphasize these same standards, in addition to encouraging customers to not purchase their products. Alright, that might not sound right. They encourage their customers to only buy their products if they actually need them. If a customer absolutely needs a jacket, they should go to Patagonia because not only are they extremely well made, but they also are made in a very sustainable way. However, Patagonia encourages customers to purchase their products of they truly need them. They do not like the concept of excessive possessions, thus excessive amounts of fabric being thrown away and damaging the environment. They want you to purchase your necessary pieces from them, but to not go out and buy ten more jackets that look just like it.</p>
	<p>My company is trying to find a mix between these two concepts. I am trying to make shopping sustainable more mainstream and easier to access for everyone. This means that the price has to be reasonable and there has to be a wide variety of ways to purchase these products. However, I do not want to risk straying from our mission of being sustainable. We will keep to this standard when combining it with this concept of being a mainstream, curated brand like an Urban Outfitters. We will take in pieces from numerous sustainable brands that are all held to a firm standard or minimum amount of sustainability required in their practices of production.</p>
	<p>This task has been the most challenging task of my entire life, however, I have also never felt so much joy and reward from a task. I have been able to work with designers and bring my pieces to life, and it is a dream come true to know that they are being made in a way that is not leaving a negative impact on the Earth. Also, I love knowing that I am slowly but surely making an impact on the fashion industry. It has been this same system of focusing on personal gain and ignoring the environmental loss, but I am ready to find a way to accomplish both. I am pursuing success—I want as many people as possible to be able to purchase our clothing, but I want to do it for a positive reason. I want to help save the planet.</p>
